# generic-webpack-react
This project is a boilerplate for React applications using Webpack. It is based on the tutorials provided by SurvivalJS on the topic, found [here](http://survivejs.com/webpack/). I have chosen to use [Less](http://lesscss.org/) for styling, but using any other CSS-parser (or pure CSS) is pretty much straight-forward as described  [in the tutorials](http://survivejs.com/webpack/loading-assets/loading-styles/).
