# generic-webpack-react
This project is a boilerplate for React applications using Webpack. It is based on the tutorials provided by SurvivalJS on the topic, found <a href="http://survivejs.com/webpack/" target="\_blank">here</a>. I have chosen to use <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="\_blank">Less</a> for styling, but using any other CSS-parser (or pure CSS) is pretty much straight-forward as described  <a href="http://survivejs.com/webpack/loading-assets/loading-styles/" target="\_blank">in the tutorials</a>.
